There are a lot of things in there, from name mapping over garbage handling to widget class definition. Some tools are straightforward, others are quite complex. I'll try to explain everything as best I can.</p> <h2>Fundamentals</h2> <p>There are three layers working beneath Qtools, of which you need to know about in order to understand how to use the various facilities Qtools offers.</p> <h3><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/">Qt</a></h3> <p>Qt is a gigantic toolkit that mainly concerns itself with GUI creation. It is cross-platform and written in C++. While its size and large user-base means that it is very mature and usable for pretty much any kind of GUI, the fact that it's written in C++ makes things complicated. The usual way to interoperate with C++ libraries and projects is to create a C API wrapper.</p> <h3><a href="https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Languages/Smoke">Smoke</a></h3> <p>And this is what Smoke does. It generates a C wrapper so that other languages can make use of Qt through C-FFI. Smoke is divided up into a bunch of modules, each being associated with a part of Qt, such as qtcore, qtgui, qtopengl, phonon, etc.</p> <h3><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/commonqt/">CommonQt</a></h3> <p>The heavy lifting and ground-work that is required to interface with Smoke (and thus with Qt) is done by CommonQt. By itself, CommonQt offers a complete framework to create Qt GUIs from Common Lisp out.</p> <h3><a href="https://shinmera.github.io/qtools/">Qtools</a></h3> <p>Unfortunately, working with CommonQt itself is a bit awkward. While it offers everything you need, the way you have to make use of it is sub-par. Qtools attempts to help with this by offering another layer over CommonQt to smooth everything out. However, since you might not like certain parts of the Qtools ecosystem, it should be possible for you to only use the features you like, rather than being forced to use everything. So, you can always mix and match &quot;plain&quot; CommonQt and Qtools extensions.</p> <h2>Getting Started</h2> <h3>Qt</h3> <p>In case you already know Qt, you may skip this part and go straight to the next section. I'll briefly explain some of the core Qt concepts and how they fit together. However, you should still read the <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/">official Qt documentation</a> for anything that's left unclear.</p> <p>Since Qt is a C++ library it is heavily focused around classes and methods. At the top of the class hierarchy sits <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qobject.html">QObject</a>. Almost all classes in Qt inherit from this. The more important one for us however is the <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qwidget.html">QWidget</a> class, which already gives you everything you need to get started. It can act as a window or be contained in other widgets. It has all the sizing mechanics and is properly hooked into the event system that allows you to catch when keys are pressed, the window is resized, and so forth.</p> <p>Usually you create your new widgets by subclassing something like QWidget and then overriding methods to do what you want or simply attach other widgets to it and connect them up so that they can communicate to each other via the signal system. Classes have slots and signals. Signals are a form of method signature that describe a list of arguments and their type. Slots are the corresponding methods that perform actions when a signal reaches them. Wiring things up functions by connecting a signal and a source instance to a slot and a target instance. When then a signal is signalled onto the source instance, the target instance's slot method is called.</p> <p>And that's pretty much all of the core mechanics that you need to know about. For everything else, you usually refer to the documentation page for the specific class involved and see what kind of methods or signals you can use to do what you want. Seriously, the docs are good. I use them constantly while developing.</p> <h3>Qtools</h3> <p>Before getting started with explaining the details on the various parts of Qtools, I'll go through a basic project setup of a project using it.</p> <p>First you will want an ASDF system to define your project. In its dependencies it should contain <code>:qtools</code> and the smoke modules you require, usually just <code>:qtcore</code> and <code>:qtgui</code>.</p> <pre><code>(asdf:defsystem qtools-intro
  ...
  :depends-on (:qtools :qtcore :qtgui))
</code></pre> <p>If you want to just try things out on the REPL real quick, just <code>(ql:quickload '(qtools qtcore qtgui))</code> should suffice.</p> <p>Then of course you'll usually want a package to put all your stuff in. Instead of <code>:use #:cl</code> you will most likely want to <code>:use #:cl+qt</code>. This package combines the symbols of the common-lisp base package, the commonqt package, and qtools. Thus all the symbols and functions you usually need for development are already included.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#CL+QT:DEFPACKAGE">defpackage</a> #:qtools-intro
  (:use #:cl+qt)
  (:export #:main))
</code></pre> <p>CommonQt, and Qtools itself, require a few extensions to the standard reader syntax. For this reason you will want to change the readtable using <code><a href="#CL+QT:IN-READTABLE">named-readtables:in-readtable</a></code>, which <code>cl+qt</code> includes. Readtable changes are on a <em>per-file</em> basis, so you need both an <code><a href="#CL+QT:IN-PACKAGE">in-package</a></code> and an <code><a href="#CL+QT:IN-READTABLE">in-readtable</a></code> call on every file.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#CL+QT:IN-PACKAGE">in-package</a> #:qtools-intro)
(<a href="#CL+QT:IN-READTABLE">in-readtable</a> :qtools)
</code></pre> <p>This sets up everything you need to get started writing an actual GUI. So let's do that as well. In Qt things are organised as widgets. Windows are widgets, buttons are widgets, text fields are widgets, etc. Qtools mirrors this.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-WIDGET">define-widget</a> main-window (QWidget)
  ())
</code></pre> <p>This <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-WIDGET">define-widget</a></code> form is syntactically equivalent to <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFCLASS">defclass</a></code>. The only change is that the first argument in the superclass list is the Qt class to inherit from. Now we'll want to add some things to display in the widget.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a> (main-window name) (<a href="#Q+:MAKE-QLINEEDIT">q+:make-qlineedit</a> main-window)
  (<a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a> (<a href="#Q+:PLACEHOLDER-TEXT">q+:placeholder-text</a> name) &quot;Your name please.&quot;))

(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a> (main-window go) (<a href="#Q+:MAKE-QPUSHBUTTON">q+:make-qpushbutton</a> &quot;Go!&quot; main-window))
</code></pre> <p>This adds a QLineEdit widget called <code>name</code> to the <code>main-window</code> and sets its placeholder text to <code>&quot;Your name please.&quot;</code>. The second form adds a button called <code><a href="#CL+QT:GO">go</a></code> with a label of <code>&quot;Go!&quot;</code>. Simple stuff. The body of the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a></code> form can contain any number of statements. By default, the symbols of all the other subwidgets and slots defined prior to the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a></code> form are bound to their corresponding values. This is useful if you for example need to define a layout, as we will do now.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a> (main-window layout) (<a href="#Q+:MAKE-QHBOXLAYOUT">q+:make-qhboxlayout</a> main-window)
  (<a href="#Q+:ADD-WIDGET">q+:add-widget</a> layout name)
  (<a href="#Q+:ADD-WIDGET">q+:add-widget</a> layout go))
</code></pre> <p>This sets up the displaying part of our GUI, but so far we haven't made it react to anything yet. Reacting to events in Qt happens through signals and slots. Slots are functions that receive signals, and signals are event carriers.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SIGNAL">define-signal</a> (main-window name-set) (<a href="#CL+QT:STRING">string</a>))

(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SLOT">define-slot</a> (main-window go) ()
  (<a href="#CL+QT:DECLARE">declare</a> (<a href="#QTOOLS:CONNECTED">connected</a> go (pressed)))
  (<a href="#CL+QT:DECLARE">declare</a> (<a href="#QTOOLS:CONNECTED">connected</a> name (return-pressed)))
  (<a href="#QTOOLS:SIGNAL!">signal!</a> main-window (name-set string) (<a href="#Q+:TEXT">q+:text</a> name)))

(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SLOT">define-slot</a> (main-window name-set) ((new-name string))
  (<a href="#CL+QT:DECLARE">declare</a> (<a href="#QTOOLS:CONNECTED">connected</a> main-window (name-set string)))
  (<a href="#Q+:QMESSAGEBOX-INFORMATION">q+:qmessagebox-information</a> main-window &quot;Greetings&quot; (<a href="#CL+QT:FORMAT">format</a> NIL &quot;Good day to you, ~a!&quot; new-name)))
</code></pre> <p>We're doing things a bit roundabout here to illustrate creating signals. <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SIGNAL">define-signal</a></code> introduces a new signal called <code>name-set</code> that takes a single <code><a href="#CL+QT:STRING">string</a></code> as argument. We then define a new slot that is connected to the <code><a href="#CL+QT:GO">go</a></code> button's <code>pressed</code> signal (which has no arguments) as well as the <code>name</code> field's <code>return-pressed</code>. We then simply fetch the current text of our <code>name</code> field and send it out again with our custom signal. The second slot catches this signal again and uses it to display a message box.</p> <p>You can now try and see what kind of magical wonders you have created by using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-MAIN-WINDOW">with-main-window</a></code> to launch everything: <code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-MAIN-WINDOW">with-main-window</a> (window 'main-window))</code>. This will block until your window is closed, as Qt needs to capture the thread to handle events.</p> <p>And that's that. The only thing we didn't take a look at here is <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-OVERRIDE">define-override</a></code>, which allows you to define override functions for your Qt classes. So, if you for example want to manually draw onto a widget you can override its <code>paintEvent</code> method using this.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-OVERRIDE">define-override</a> (main-window paint-event) (event)
  (<a href="#CL+QT:DECLARE">declare</a> (<a href="#CL+QT:IGNORE">ignore</a> event))
  (<a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-FINALIZING">with-finalizing</a> ((painter (<a href="#Q+:MAKE-QPAINTER">q+:make-qpainter</a> main-window)))
    (<a href="#Q+:FILL-RECT">q+:fill-rect</a> painter (<a href="#Q+:RECT">q+:rect</a> main-window) (<a href="#Q+:QT.WHITE">q+:qt.white</a>))))
</code></pre> <p>This'll make the background of our window completely white. The important thing to note here is the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-FINALIZING">with-finalizing</a></code>. What has been rather well hidden from you so far, is that as Qt is a C++ framework, you will have to do manual memory management. Qtools makes this a lot easier by offering macros and automations to take most of it off of your hands. For example, all the sub widgets we defined are automatically deleted once the main window is.</p> <p>A general note about developing with Qtools/CommonQt: While custom function bodies such as from qt-slots, overrides, initializers, and finalizers reside on the CL side and can thus be redefined at any time and take effect immediately, adding or removing qt-slots and overrides will not affect already created instances. This is to say, if you run your application and recompile your override, the effect will be visible immediately. But if you add a new slot, override, or signal, the existing instance will not have them. This is due to the fact that these things need to be tied to the C++ class, which will not update existing instances when it is changed, like CLOS usually does. This means that if you change a running widget by adding new components, you need to recreate or restart it to see the effects.</p> <h2>Deployment</h2> <p>So, you've built a neat little Qt application and you would like to deploy it and ship it to people that aren't developers. For this, you will want to dump a binary and bundle it together with the necessary shared libraries. Qtools will take care of this for you, to the point where it becomes very trivial to do.</p> <p>You will need an ASDF system that compiles your program and add the following options to your system definition:</p> <pre><code>:defsystem-depends-on (:qtools)
:build-operation &quot;qt-program-op&quot;
:build-pathname &quot;executable-name&quot;
:entry-point &quot;my-package:my-launch-function&quot;
</code></pre> <p>You can change the string of <code>:build-pathname</code> to whatever pathname-name you'd like your executable to have. You should change the stirng of <code>:entry-point</code> to be a designator for an external symbol that is either your main window class name, or a function that handles the launching of your GUI.</p> <p>Once you have updated your ASD, you should launch a clean instance of your implementation from the command line -- make sure not to load slime or anything else that creates threads. Then simply invoke <code>(asdf:operate :build-op :system-name :force T)</code>. For sbcl, that would be:</p> <pre><code>sbcl --eval &quot;(asdf:operate :build-op :system-name :force T)&quot;
</code></pre> <p>This will compile your system, gather some info on it, copy the necessary shared libraries to the deployment folder, and finally dump an image with your system ready to go. It should put it all into a new <code>bin</code> folder within your project's root. If everything went right, you should be able to just launch the executable within and be greeted with your nice GUI. You can then just ZIP up the build folder and ship that-- it should contain all of the necessary shared library dependencies to run outside of your development environment.</p> <p>As an example for a working system that can be deployed, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/shinmera/halftone">halftone</a> or <a href="https://github.com/shirakumo/cl-gamepad">cl-gamepad-visualizer</a>.</p> <p>For the case where you depend on further external libraries that are not managed by Qtools by default, you will need to tell Qtools about them so that it can deploy them alongside. To do this, use the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-USER-LIBS">define-user-libs</a></code> macro. In the case of the cl-gamepad-visualizer, we depend on a library called &quot;libstem-gamepad&quot; which is managed by the library itself in a static folder. So, we just tell Qtools that it should look in that static folder and dump the CFFI library named <code>cl-gamepad-cffi:libstem-gamepad</code>.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-USER-LIBS">qtools:define-user-libs</a> (libstem-gamepad cl-gamepad-cffi::*static*)
  (cl-gamepad-cffi:libstem-gamepad))
</code></pre> <p>See the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-USER-LIBS">define-user-libs</a></code> docstring for more information.</p> <p>For more customisation you can also add custom functions to be run at the individual stages by pushing the function onto the appropriate hooks variable, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:*BUILD-HOOKS*">*build-hooks*</a></code>, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:*BOOT-HOOKS*">*boot-hooks*</a></code>, and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:*QUIT-HOOKS*">*quit-hooks*</a></code>.</p> <h2>Qtools Components</h2> <h3>Name Conversion</h3> <p>Common Lisp and C++ follow different naming conventions for classes, variables, methods, and types. Qtools offers a couple of functions to attempt to translate between the two. Finding a Qt class can be done with <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FIND-QT-CLASS-NAME">find-qt-class-name</a></code>. It searches a static table of known Qt classes (<code><a href="#QTOOLS:*QT-CLASS-MAP*">*qt-class-map*</a></code>) by first stripping all dashes from the name, and then case-insensitively finding a matching name.</p> <p>Translating method names can be done through <code><a href="#QTOOLS:TO-METHOD-NAME">to-method-name</a></code>, which translates dashes to mean that the next character should be in uppercase. So <code>foo-bar</code> is <code>fooBar</code>. In case you pass it a string instead of a symbol however, it will not do any translation. This is important to take care of edge-cases, where this primitive translation would prohibit using a certain name. If you need a method signature instead of just a name, there are <code><a href="#QTOOLS:SPECIFIED-TYPE-METHOD-NAME">specified-type-method-name</a></code> that takes a name and a list of type specifiers, and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DETERMINED-TYPE-METHOD-NAME">determined-type-method-name</a></code>, which attempts to determine the type of the arguments, rather than requiring type specifiers directly.</p> <p>Types are translated using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:QT-TYPE-OF">qt-type-of</a></code>, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:EQT-TYPE-OF">eqt-type-of</a></code>, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:QT-TYPE-FOR">qt-type-for</a></code>, and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:TO-TYPE-NAME">to-type-name</a></code>. Where <code><a href="#QTOOLS:QT-TYPE-FOR">qt-type-for</a></code> translates a type specifier and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:QT-TYPE-OF">qt-type-of</a></code> tries to determine the type through a value. Reversing from a Qt type specifier to a CL type is possible with <code><a href="#QTOOLS:CL-TYPE-FOR">cl-type-for</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:ECL-TYPE-FOR">ecl-type-for</a></code>.</p> <h3>Object Handling</h3> <p>In C++ there usually is no garbage collector, so you need to carefully clean up yourself or you'll create a memory leak. In Common Lisp we're used to the luxury of not having to worry about this, thanks to garbage collection. Sadly, we cannot use the garbage collector to also take care of C++ objects, as they live in a different world not governed by us. So, garbage collection of Qt objects is still our own worry.</p> <p>To make this all just a smidgeon easier, Qtools introduces a system of <em>finalizables</em>, the central point of which is the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> generic function. This function should take care of all necessary cleanup when an object is no longer needed. For <code><a href="#CL+QT:QOBJECT">qobject</a></code>s, this means running eventual cleanup (through <code>finalize-using-class</code>) and then being <code><a href="#CL+QT:DELETE">delete</a></code>d, thus properly removed from memory. However, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> can not only be used for Qt objects, but for anything else as well. Especially interesting here are <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZABLE">finalizable</a></code> objects, whose slots can specify an additional argument <code>:finalized</code>, which dictates whether <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> is run on the slot's value when the class instance is <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code>d.</p> <p>Often times we only need Qt instances for a certain lexical context of code. For this case, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-FINALIZING">with-finalizing</a></code> (and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-FINALIZING*">with-finalizing*</a></code>) can be used, which is a counterpart to <code><a href="#CL+QT:LET">let</a></code> that calls <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> on all its bindings once the form exits. This will take care of most cases. For cases where the instance may escape, or has to stay bound in a closure, there's <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-GC-FINALIZED">with-gc-finalized</a></code>. This wraps the value of each binding in a <code><a href="#QTOOLS:GC-FINALIZED">gc-finalized</a></code> object. Using such a container, we can use Common Lisp's garbage collector to keep track of the references and, once the object is garbage collected it calls <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> on its inner value, ensuring proper removal. The <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-GC-FINALIZED">with-gc-finalized</a></code> uses a <code><a href="#CL+QT:SYMBOL-MACROLET">symbol-macrolet</a></code> to ensure that you don't have to worry about the boxing. However, if you manually use <code><a href="#QTOOLS:GC-FINALIZED">gc-finalized</a></code> objects, there's the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:MAKE-GC-FINALIZED">make-gc-finalized</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:UNBOX">unbox</a></code> functions (with corresponding reader macros <code>#&gt;</code> and <code>#&lt;</code> in the <code>:qtools</code> read-table).</p> <p>While this kind of system takes care of a lot of cases, it's still not perfect and it may happen that you accidentally create a memory leak somewhere. I wish there was an easier way, but alas, life is difficult. You can try to solve this kind of situation by debugging Qtools and keeping track of which objects get finalized and which don't.</p> <p>Another occasional task is to copy an object instance. Qtools offers a <code><a href="#QTOOLS:COPY">copy</a></code> and <code>copy-using-class</code> methods which handle proper copying for a couple of Qt objects, but sadly by far not all. If you want to use the copying system for a class that isn't handled by Qtools by default, you can define your own using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-COPY-METHOD">define-copy-method</a></code>.</p> <p>Qtools will handle the printing of QObject instances as well and provides you with a mechanism of defining print methods for a qclass, just like you normally would for CL classes by <code><a href="#CL+QT:PRINT-OBJECT">print-object</a></code>. Simply use <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-PRINT-METHOD">define-print-method</a></code>.</p> <h3>Widgets</h3> <p>Qt deals with widgets. As such, making everything associated with them simple and easy to use should be a primary objective. Qtools' widget system attempts to do exactly that. The central part to this is the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-WIDGET">define-widget</a></code> macro. This expands to a <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFCLASS">defclass</a></code> with the following effects: It sets <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET-CLASS">widget-class</a></code> as the metaclass, sets the first item of the superclass list as the qt-superclass, and injects <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET">widget</a></code> as a superclass, if it isn't one already. This means that essentially you can use anything you could in a standard <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFCLASS">defclass</a></code> without having to worry about the necessary default options.</p> <p>However, just with a single <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-WIDGET">define-widget</a></code> you won't get far ahead. You still need to use CommonQt's way of declaring slots, signals, and overrides, which is quite cumbersome. You can do that of course, but there is a more convenient method, which is to use <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SLOT">define-slot</a></code>, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SIGNAL">define-signal</a></code>, and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-OVERRIDE">define-override</a></code>. These essentially translate to class options, albeit in a detached way. Each of these define statements is of the following syntax:</p> <pre><code>(define-* (<a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET-CLASS">widget-class</a> name) arglist &amp;body body)
</code></pre> <p>Some of them take optional extra arguments in the name-list, such as a method-name in the case of <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SLOT">define-slot</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-OVERRIDE">define-override</a></code>. In the case of <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SIGNAL">define-signal</a></code> the body is discarded. However, even with these extensions things are rather cumbersome: You need to manually define slots for each of the widgets you want to use inside your widget class, and define their behaviour in an <code><a href="#CL+QT:INITIALIZE-INSTANCE">initialize-instance</a></code> function. This is unwieldy, which is why Qtools also adds <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-INITIALIZER">define-initializer</a></code>, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-FINALIZER">define-finalizer</a></code>, and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a></code>. The first two follow in signature to the above minus the <code>arglist</code> and do what you might expect them to do: handle initialization and finalization. The initializer and finalizer forms take an optional priority argument in their name-list. The higher, the sooner. <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a></code> on the other hand looks like this:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a> (<a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET-CLASS">widget-class</a> name) initform &amp;body body)
</code></pre> <p>And its effects are two-fold. First, it adds a finalized slot to the widget-class called name. Then, it adds an initializer (with priority 10) that sets the slot-value to the value of <code>initform</code> and then evaluates the <code>body</code> forms. This by itself takes care of the repetitive slot and initializer definition, but without an extra helper called <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-SLOTS-BOUND">with-slots-bound</a></code>, it would still be annoying to write functions, as you would have to reference widgets using <code><a href="#CL+QT:SLOT-VALUE">slot-value</a></code> everywhere. <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-SLOTS-BOUND">with-slots-bound</a></code> is like <code><a href="#CL+QT:WITH-SLOTS">with-slots</a></code>, but it binds <em>all</em> direct class-slot values to their respective slot names. Every <code>define-*</code> function's body is automatically wrapped in a <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-SLOTS-BOUND">with-slots-bound</a></code>, to make this convenience possible.</p> <p>If you do not like this behaviour, due to potential symbol clashes and general confusion that might arise from the implicit action, you can instead use <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">cl+qt:defmethod</a></code> and <code><a href="#CL+QT:DECLARE">declare</a></code> statements. This is actually what all the <code>define-*</code> (with the exception of <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SIGNAL">define-signal</a></code>) expand to: A <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">cl+qt:defmethod</a></code> with an appropriate declaration inserted into the body. The <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">cl+qt:defmethod</a></code> behaves exaclty like <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/defmethod">cl:defmethod</a></code> with the exception of allowing the handling of custom declaration forms. Qtools defines the following declarations: <code><a href="#QTOOLS:SLOT">slot</a></code>, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:OVERRIDE">override</a></code>, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:INITIALIZER">initializer</a></code>, and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZER">finalizer</a></code>. In the case of a <code><a href="#QTOOLS:SLOT">slot</a></code> definition, an extra declaration called <code><a href="#QTOOLS:CONNECTED">connected</a></code> is also available. The effects of the declarations are as you might expect, and have the following signatures:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:SLOT">slot</a> slot-name args)
(<a href="#QTOOLS:CONNECTED">connected</a> slot-name (signal-name &amp;rest args))
(<a href="#QTOOLS:OVERRIDE">override</a> &amp;optional method-name)
(<a href="#QTOOLS:INITIALIZER">initializer</a> &amp;optional (priority 0))
(<a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZER">finalizer</a> &amp;optional (priority 0))
</code></pre> <p>The user may define additional declarations using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-METHOD-DECLARATION">define-method-declaration</a></code>.</p> <p>At this point it is useful to note about the general startup sequence of a widget. Once <code><a href="#CL+QT:MAKE-INSTANCE">make-instance</a></code> is called, it calls to <code><a href="#CL+QT:INITIALIZE-INSTANCE">initialize-instance</a></code>. Qtools defines a primary method on this specialized on the widget class. It then immediately calls the next method (<code><a href="#CL+QT:CALL-NEXT-METHOD">call-next-method</a></code>), followed by <code><a href="#QTOOLS:CONSTRUCT">construct</a></code> which should call <code><a href="#CL+QT:NEW">qt:new</a></code>, instantiating the C++ parts. Following that are the initializers in the order of their priority (highest goes first). This means that if you (for some reason) define an <code>:after</code> method on <code><a href="#CL+QT:INITIALIZE-INSTANCE">initialize-instance</a></code> for your own widget, it will be run after all initializers have completed. For finalization it is the same: all finalizers are run before your own <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> method is run. However, if you define a <code>:before</code> method on <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> for your class, it will be run before the <code>:finalized</code> slots are finalized, otherwise all primary and <code>:after</code> methods should not access <code>:finalized</code> slots anymore. If you absolutely do need to do things before normal initialization or finalization, you can define an <code>:around</code> method.</p> <p>One last widget-related definition form is <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-MENU">define-menu</a></code>, which is a very convenient way of specifying menus:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-MENU">define-menu</a> (my-widget File)
  (:item (&quot;Open...&quot; (ctrl o))
    (open-file))
  (:menu recent-files)
  (:separator)
  (:item (&quot;Save&quot; (ctrl s))
    (save-file))
  (:item (&quot;Save As...&quot; (ctrl alt s))
    (save-file NIL))
  (:menu &quot;Export&quot;
    (:item &quot;PNG&quot; (save-file NIL &quot;png&quot;)))
  (:separator)
  (:item (&quot;Quit&quot; (ctrl q))
    (#_close widget)))
</code></pre> <p>Out of the box, it supports <code>:item</code>, <code>:menu</code>, and <code>:separator</code> components. The item takes a name, which can be either a string for a label, a list of string and keyboard mnemonic, or a symbol indicating the class slot that contains the item widget, and it takes a body of forms to execute if the item is triggered. Menus take a name as a string and a body of components to contain, or a symbol indicating the slot that contains the menu widget. New components can be added with <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-MENU-CONTENT-TYPE">define-menu-content-type</a></code>.</p> <p>If your widget has a Qt superclass to whose constructor you would like to pass certain arguments, you can do so by adding a method on <code><a href="#QTOOLS:CONSTRUCT">construct</a></code> that calls <code><a href="#CL+QT:NEW">qt:new</a></code> with the arguments you need. You can also use a shorthand to do the same by adding a <code>(:constructor ..)</code> option to your widget definition form. This expands to a <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">defmethod</a></code> form that binds all slots (<code><a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-ALL-SLOTS-BOUND">with-all-slots-bound</a></code>) and otherwise just contains a call to <code><a href="#CL+QT:NEW">qt:new</a></code> supplying the arguments of the option form verbatim. In effect this means that any unquoted symbol in the option denotes a slot reference. Note that the call to <code><a href="#QTOOLS:CONSTRUCT">construct</a></code> happens before the widget initializers are run. Thus you will not be able to use slot values that are set by subwidgets or initializers.</p> <p>As a final touch, Qtools offers macros for connecting slots and emitting signals. These translate to CommonQt's <code><a href="#CL+QT:EMIT-SIGNAL">emit-signal</a></code> and <code><a href="#CL+QT:CONNECT">connect</a></code> functions, and thus just offer a bit of syntactic sugar. They're called <code><a href="#QTOOLS:SIGNAL!">signal!</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:CONNECT!">connect!</a></code>. Their use is simple enough:</p> <pre><code> (<a href="#QTOOLS:CONNECT!">connect!</a> input (text-edited string) widget (text-changed string))
 (<a href="#QTOOLS:SIGNAL!">signal!</a> input (text-edited string) &quot;Eyyyy&quot;)
</code></pre> <p>An experimental variant for the adventurous is <code><a href="#QTOOLS:GENERIC-SIGNAL">generic-signal</a></code>, which attempts to determine the argument types by their values at run-time. It does therefore not require specifying the type explicitly, but might instead screw up and choose a wrong type for the signal and thus fail to emit.</p> <h3>Q+</h3> <p>By default with CommonQt, calling Qt methods happens with the <code>#_</code> reader macro. This requires you to follow the proper case of the class and method names. Having this kind of mixture of conventions in the code is a bit jarring. While Qtools offers solutions to deal with the discrepancies of defining your own classes and widgets using the various <code>define-*</code> macros, Q+ fixes the method calling discrepancy. In order to use Q+ you have a choice of either using the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a></code> macro, or using the <code>:qtools</code> read-table. Using the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a></code> macro directly an example translates like this:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#CL+QT:LET">let</a> ((widget (#_new QWidget)))
  (#_setWindowTitle widget &quot;Hello!&quot;)
  (#_show widget)
  (#_exec *qapplication*))

(<a href="#CL+QT:LET">let</a> ((widget (<a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a> make-qwidget)))
  (<a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a> set-window-title widget &quot;Hello!&quot;)
  (<a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a> show widget)
  (<a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a> exec *qapplication*))
</code></pre> <p>And the same using the readtable:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#CL+QT:LET">let</a> ((widget (<a href="#Q+:MAKE-QWIDGET">q+:make-qwidget</a>)))
  (<a href="#Q+:SET-WINDOW-TITLE">q+:set-window-title</a> widget &quot;Hello!&quot;)
  (<a href="#Q+:SHOW">q+:show</a> widget)
  (<a href="#Q+:EXEC">q+:exec</a> *qapplication*))
</code></pre> <p>The difference is minimal in the typed code. However, the second approach will give you the convenience of letting the editor display the possible arguments and a docstring linking to the Qt methods. The second example is read by the Common Lisp reader to the first example. There is therefore no code difference in how the two work. If you use the <code>cl+qt</code> package, you can also take advantage of an extended <code><a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a></code> macro. Using it, the second line would look like so:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a> (<a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a> window-title widget) &quot;Hello!&quot;)
</code></pre> <p>Some of the setter functions require multiple values to be set at once. The updated <code><a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a></code> can also deal with that:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a> (<a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a> window painter) (<a href="#CL+QT:VALUES">values</a> 0 0 100 100))
</code></pre> <p>The <code><a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a></code> has extra support for <code><a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a></code>, but is otherwise identical to <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/setf">cl:setf</a></code> and actually expands to that for all other places.</p> <p>In order to access enum values, you simply use the class name followed by a dot and the enum name. Constructors are the class name prefixed with &quot;make&quot;. Static functions are the class name, a dash, and the method name in the standard translation scheme.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#Q+:QT.BLUE">q+:qt.blue</a>)
(<a href="#Q+:MAKE-QPUSHBUTTON">q+:make-qpushbutton</a> &quot;Foo!&quot;)
(<a href="#Q+:QMESSAGEBOX-INFORMATION">q+:qmessagebox-information</a> parent &quot;!&quot; &quot;hello!&quot;)
</code></pre> <p>For the specific arguments, names, and everything else, refer to the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/">Qt4.8</a> documentation. It's very good, trust me. The only thing you need to be aware of is the name conversion rules that Q+ uses to determine the proper Lisp symbol to use:</p> <ul> <li>Method <code>QImage::constScanLine</code> =&gt; <code><a href="#Q+:CONST-SCAN-LINE">q+:const-scan-line</a></code></li> <li>Method <code>Foo::set_widget</code> =&gt; <code><a href="#Q+:SET_WIDGET">q+:set_widget</a></code></li> <li>Constant <code>QImage::InvertRgb</code> =&gt; <code><a href="#Q+:QIMAGE.INVERT-RGB">q+:qimage.invert-rgb</a></code></li> <li>Constant <code>QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied</code> =&gt; <code><a href="#Q+:QIMAGE.FORMAT_ARGB32_PREMULTIPLIED">q+:qimage.format_argb32_premultiplied</a></code></li> <li>Static Method <code>QFileDialog::getExistingDirectory</code> =&gt; <code><a href="#Q+:QFILEDIALOG-GET-EXISTING-DIRECTORY">q+:qfiledialog-get-existing-directory</a></code></li> <li>Constructor <code>QImage::QImage</code> =&gt; <code><a href="#Q+:MAKE-QIMAGE">q+:make-qimage</a></code></li> </ul> <p>For Q+ to work seamlessly in conjunction with ASDF systems and compiling/loading code, you have to make sure that the smoke modules are set up correctly.</p> <p><code><a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a></code> and the reader extension dynamically compile wrapper functions for the Qt methods you access. You can, however, also precompile all possible methods for the currently active set of smoke modules. To do this, you can either <code>:depends-on (:q+)</code> or compile a source file using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WRITE-EVERYTHING-TO-FILE">write-everything-to-file</a></code> and include it in your ASDF system. If you choose this approach, you will not need to switch the readtable or use the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a></code> macro, as the package will be available fully populated.</p> <h3>Smoke Modules</h3> <p>In order to be able to use the various parts of Qt, the corresponding smoke modules need to be loaded. By default CommonQt loads <code>qtcore</code> and <code>qtgui</code> when <code><a href="#CL+QT:MAKE-QAPPLICATION">make-qapplication</a></code> is called. However, if you want to use, say, the OpenGL parts you'll also need <code>qtopengl</code>.</p> <p>Qtools provides ASDF systems for all the different smoke modules. That way, you can simply push the modules you want into your project's ASDF system dependencies and it'll ensure that the modules are available at compile and load time. Having the modules loaded at both times is especially important for Q+ to work properly. An example system making use of this would look like</p> <pre><code>(asdf:defsystem foo
  ...
  :depends-on (:qtcore :qtgui))
</code></pre> <p>For a list of available smoke modules, see <code><a href="#QTOOLS:*SMOKE-MODULES*">*smoke-modules*</a></code>.</p> <h3>Fast Calling</h3> <p>In some cases it is vital to minimise overhead to a method call. Since usually dispatch is dynamic at run-time and un/marshalling of arguments and return values is involved, the standard way of calling methods might be too slow. In that case, you can use Qtools' fast-call mechanism to perform a method call as quickly as possible. At a cost, naturally.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#CL+QT:LET">let</a> ((size (<a href="#Q+:MAKE-QSIZE">q+:make-qsize</a> 100 100)))
  (<a href="#QTOOLS:FAST-CALL">fast-call</a> (set-height QSize int) size 200)
  size)
</code></pre> <p>Fast-calling is possible if you know the exact method signature to call and are willing to translate the arguments to their proper required CFFI types. In the case of passing QObjects, you must pass their pointer. You can get that pointer by <code>qt::qobject-pointer</code>.</p> <h2>Examples</h2> <p>A couple of example applications using Qtools can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools/tree/master/examples/">examples/</a> folder: <code>qtools-evaluator</code>, <code>qtools-titter</code>, <code>qtools-melody</code>, and <code>qtools-opengl</code>. Each of them can be loaded by their name, and launched using the <code>main</code> function from their package.</p> <h2>Extending Qtools</h2> <h3>Copying and Finalizing</h3> <p>In order to account for your own objects and operations you can extend the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:COPY">copy</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> functions by using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-COPY-METHOD">define-copy-method</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-FINALIZE-METHOD">define-finalize-method</a></code> or <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">defmethod</a></code> directly. The two define macros bring the convenience of automatically resolving to a Qt class (and thus using <code>copy/finalize-using-class</code>) if possible, making it all look a bit cleaner.</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-COPY-METHOD">define-copy-method</a> (instance QPixmap)
  &quot;Creates a new QPixmap using QPixmap::copy (deep copy).&quot;
  (#_copy instance (#_rect instance)))
</code></pre> <p>Since copying and finalizing are operations associated with a certain amount of ambiguity, it is advisable to always write documentation strings for your <code><a href="#QTOOLS:COPY">copy</a></code>/<code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> methods. That way users can get a better idea of what will happen by reading about it using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DESCRIBE-COPY-METHOD">describe-copy-method</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DESCRIBE-FINALIZE-METHOD">describe-finalize-method</a></code> respectively.</p> <h3>Adding <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">defmethod</a></code> declarations</h3> <p>Using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-METHOD-DECLARATION">define-method-declaration</a></code> you can add your own processing to method declarations. Your function should extract the necessary information from its declaration arguments and the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:*METHOD*">*method*</a></code> form. Each method declaration processing function should return a single form (like a macro) to be put before the resulting <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">defmethod</a></code>. The existing declaration processors are really short:</p> <pre><code>(<a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-METHOD-DECLARATION">define-method-declaration</a> override (<a href="#CL+QT:&amp;OPTIONAL">&amp;optional</a> name)
  (<a href="#CL+QT:LET">let</a> ((slot (<a href="#QTOOLS:TO-METHOD-NAME">qtools:to-method-name</a> (<a href="#CL+QT:OR">or</a> name (form-fiddle:lambda-name *method*)))))
    (<a href="#QTOOLS:WITH-WIDGET-CLASS">with-widget-class</a> (<a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET-CLASS">widget-class</a>)
      `(<a href="#QTOOLS:SET-WIDGET-CLASS-OPTION">set-widget-class-option</a> ',widget-class :override '(,slot ,name)))))
</code></pre> <p>In this example we're using <a href="http://github.com/Shinmera/form-fiddle">form-fiddle</a> to parse the method form. Using a library like that to ensure proper destructuring is important, as otherwise it's easy to accidentally butcher the method form, or get the wrong information.</p> <h3>Extending the menu definition</h3> <p>The menu definition form allows for arbitrary content types, so you may add new ones yourself by using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-MENU-CONTENT-TYPE">define-menu-content-type</a></code>. Each content type definition can return two values: an initform and a side-form. The initform will be put into the initialization function for the menu and thus evaluated when the widget is created. The side-form is put alongside the initializer definition and thus evaluated during compilation. If your menu type needs to modify the widget class in some way, that should be done through the side-forms. If it needs to connect signals, add items, or perform similar actions that involve Qt, that should go into the initform. You can call the expansion of other component types using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:BUILD-MENU-CONTENT">build-menu-content</a></code>. During the time your content-type function is run, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:*WIDGET*">*widget*</a></code> is bound to the class-name of the widget and during initialization it is bound to the actual widget instance.</p> <h2>Debugging Qtools</h2> <p>Since Qtools does a bunch of contrived things, you might want to check what exactly is done if something doesn't go according to plan. I'm not excluding the possibility of bugs being around that mess your code up. In order to check this, you will want to load <a href="http://shinmera.github.io/verbose/">verbose</a> before loading Qtools and set the logging level to trace: <code>(<a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a> (v:repl-level) :trace)</code>. Qtools will emit log messages when you compile <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-WIDGET">define-widget</a></code> forms that contain the generated options. It will also log all objects that get passed to <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:COPY">copy</a></code>. Hopefully the log output will help you in discovering what's going on behind the scenes.</p> <h2>Qtools Concepts</h2> <p>Qtools has grown to be a large library with a lot of rather complicated concepts. I will try to describe them here, in order to retain some information in non-code form and make things clearer to the average user. It is not necessary to read and understand this section to use Qtools, but it may be useful to be aware of the underlying ideas and functionality that make Qtools work.</p> <h3>Finalizables</h3> <p>A finalizable is implemented using two classes, one serving as the metaclass and the other as a superclass. The metaclass is required in order to allow a custom slot type that supports the <code>:finalized</code> argument. The superclass is necessary in order to allow methods such as <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> to operate on instances of the finalizable classes. The handling of the finalized slots is done through a general method on <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> that scans through the slots of the class instance and then calls <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> on each slot for which the definition is set to be <code>:finalized</code>. This makes finalization of class slots automatic and convenient.</p> <p>Since finalizables don't add any metaclass properties, there is no need to manually calculate inheritance order. However, as with all custom slot definitions, the slot properties must be copied over from the direct-slot instance to the effective slot. In the case of <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZABLE-CLASS">finalizable-class</a></code> this happens in <code>compute-effective-slot-definition</code>.</p> <p>In order to support finalizing of Qt class instances that don't have a CL class equivalent, the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code> method is extended wit ha <code>finalize-using-class</code> that is dispatched to using the Qt class and the instance of a <code><a href="#CL+QT:QOBJECT">qobject</a></code> instance is passed to <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZE">finalize</a></code>.</p> <h3>Widgets</h3> <p>As with finalizables, the widget is implemented using two classes, the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET-CLASS">widget-class</a></code> metaclass and the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET">widget</a></code> superclass. These both inherit from the finalizable equivalents. The main crux of the <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET-CLASS">widget-class</a></code> lies in its <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET-CLASS-DIRECT-OPTIONS">widget-class-direct-options</a></code> and <code><a href="#QTOOLS:WIDGET-CLASS-EXTERN-OPTIONS">widget-class-extern-options</a></code>. The direct options are the options that are passed to a <code>re/</code> <code><a href="#CL+QT:INITIALIZE-INSTANCE">initialize-instance</a></code> (and thus also to <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFCLASS">defclass</a></code>). They're caught in the appropriately specialised methods and then stored on the class. The effect of this is that we can fully recompute the class definition at any time, and potentially add or remove options without influencing the original <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFCLASS">defclass</a></code> statement. This is where the extern-options come in.</p> <p>Using <code><a href="#QTOOLS:SET-WIDGET-CLASS-OPTION">set-widget-class-option</a></code> options can be added to the class definition dynamically at any point in the program. This function then adds the option to the class' extern-options and then calls <code><a href="#CL+QT:REINITIALIZE-INSTANCE">reinitialize-instance</a></code>, which in turn causes the class to get effectively redefined outside of its <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFCLASS">defclass</a></code> form. This redefinition also allows us to change CommonQt class options. Using this we can create forms outside of the original <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFCLASS">defclass</a></code> that act as if they were actually options in the <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFCLASS">defclass</a></code> form.</p> <p>Qtools effectively only provides two forms that do this: <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SIGNAL">define-signal</a></code> and <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">defmethod</a></code>. The <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SIGNAL">define-signal</a></code> is relatively straightforward and simply expands to a class option set to add a new signal option. The <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">defmethod</a></code> is an extensible machine in itself.</p> <p>What's special about the <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">cl+qt:defmethod</a></code> is that it inspects the declaration forms in the method body. It then checks for each declaration form whether a handler function exist and if so, calls that function. Such a <code><a href="#QTOOLS:METHOD-DECLARATION">method-declaration</a></code> function can then return forms to be put into the macroexpansion of the <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">cl+qt:defmethod</a></code>, before the resulting <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/defmethod">cl:defmethod</a></code>. The processed declaration is then left out of the <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/defmethod">cl:defmethod</a></code>form as it is assumed that it isn't a standard common lisp declaration. However, the declaration function also has the ability to change the contents of the <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/defmethod">cl:defmethod</a></code> form itself, by manipulating <code><a href="#QTOOLS:*METHOD*">*method*</a></code>. This allows the declaration to output special handling for the method body, for example.</p> <p>This kind of extensible declaration mechanism is necessary both to allow further evolving of Qtools in the future as well as adaptation by users. It also offers a very &quot;native-like&quot; way of specifying external effects of a method. Qtools uses this construct then to allow definition of slots, overrides, finalizers, and initializers.</p> <p>In case the user doesn't appreciate the <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">defmethod</a></code> way, Qtools then provides <code>define-*</code> alternative functions that simply wrap over <code><a href="#CL+QT:DEFMETHOD">defmethod</a></code>, establish some default bindings, and take care of naming and specialising the method.</p> <p>The <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a></code> deserves special attention here, as it does more work than the rest. A large part of defining widgets is adding sub-components to it, which is a task that usually involves a lot of repetition or awkward function sharing: Setting up a slot to hold the instance, defining or using an initializer to set it up. <code><a href="#QTOOLS:DEFINE-SUBWIDGET">define-subwidget</a></code> makes this both distributed and simple by both taking care of setting up an appropriate initializer function, and automatically adding the slot to the class using, again, <code><a href="#QTOOLS:SET-WIDGET-CLASS-OPTION">set-widget-class-option</a></code>. This slot is also always automatically set to be <code><a href="#QTOOLS:FINALIZED">finalized</a></code> in order to ensure that all widgets are properly cleaned up when the GUI is no longer needed.</p> <p>A minor problem regarding this approach is the same problem that appears with all of CL's definition forms. While developing incrementally, merely removing the definition form from the source file, will not actually remove it from the image. This can trip developers up, as definitions will still be active later. In this case it means having widgets still sticking around, or initializers running, etc. For this purpose there are corresponding <code>remove-*</code> functions to all the <code>define-*</code> functions to allow easy removal. This part cannot possibly be automated due to the nature of Common Lisp, but it is at least simple to correct should the need arise.</p> <h3>Q+</h3> <p>CommonQt's way of dealing with method calls is the simple and most direct way of doing it. The first possible alternative to remove the need for typing method names in their corresponding case would be to simply introduce a different reader macro that automatically translates a <code>example-function</code>-like name into <code>exampleFunction</code> as is done already in other parts of Qtools. However, this has two downsides, the first being that there does not exist a 1:1 mapping of methods anywhere. The dynamic computation of the function name means that there isn't a full correspondence table anywhere. The second downside is that methods are still not passable as first-class objects.</p> <p>The way to solve this is to generate actual CL wrapper functions to the method calls. This allows us to use them as first-class objects, have at least compile-time argument number checking, and have a linkage of wrapper name to Qt method by listing it in the docstring.</p> <p>In order to achieve this, there are two possible choices. First, the entirety of all possible wrappers can be computed once, and then subsequently loaded into the image and used directly. However, this creates two new problems. Computing all wrappers, compiling them, and loading them, takes a long time and subsequently litters the image with thousands of functions and symbols that won't ever be used in the program. Then, we have a problem with the smoke modules, as we need to know which modules will be used in a potential application ahead of time, load them all, and then generate the wrappers. We cannot generate wrappers for each module separately, as the methods from different classes share the same wrapper functions. This means that whenever a different set of modules is needed, the wrappers need to be regenerated, recompiled, and reloaded. A lot of time and space goes to waste with this. However, this approach also has an advantage: As all functions are always available, it is easy to develop with. Arguments and docstrings will be readily available through the editor. Qtools offers this approach through <code><a href="#QTOOLS:Q+-COMPILE-AND-LOAD">q+-compile-and-load</a></code>.</p> <p>The second approach is to dynamically only compile what is needed. That way, the image only ever contains wrappers for function that are actually called (at some point). However, this complicates things a lot. When a function is compiled that calls such a function, it doesn't exist yet. Even worse, when the form is read, the symbol for the function does not exist yet and isn't external! In order to catch this problem, a modified reader macro is necessary. This reader macro will detect when a call to a wrapper function is made, and instead transform it into a macro call that then sees to it that the wrapper will be created. Modifying the reader in such a way is a heavy change, and should only be used sparingly, however there is no alternative here. Qtools does not force you to use this reader extension, you can always just use the macro directly.</p> <p>However, dynamic compilation complications don't end there. Since we never dump the function to a file, it only ever exists in the environment it was compiled in. That means, if you compile a function that then dynamically generates the wrapper function, the wrapper won't be available anymore at load time. Qtools solves this issue with a trick. The <code><a href="#QTOOLS:Q+">q+</a></code> macro expands to a <code><a href="#CL+QT:LOAD-TIME-VALUE">load-time-value</a></code> form that then generates the wrapper function. That way, the wrapper will always be available at load- and execution time, while posing no overhead to the execution time, as it will return a value to that won't impact anything.</p> <p>Function referencing gets the same problems as function calling, so the Qtools readtable also contains an overridden <code>#'</code> reader macro to handle that. In the case of a wrapper call, it expands to <code><a href="#QTOOLS:Q+FUN">Q+FUN</a></code> which in turn expands to a <code><a href="#CL+QT:LOAD-TIME-VALUE">load-time-value</a></code> form that generates and returns the function object.</p> <p>As is probably obvious by now, Qtools also implements the second approach. Therefore, the choice as a user is yours: You can statically precompile everything and use it directly, or you an use the dynamic on the fly compilation using either a readtable expansion, or a simple macro. The concepts to make this all possible are rather complex, but the actual function wrapper compilations are quite straight-forward. The system is currently not suited for extension, but I see no need to allow that as the kind of Qt methods that can exist are fixed and Q+ should handle all that are relevant.</p> <p>Q+ does one last thing to fix the &quot;issue&quot; of having setters instead of being able to use <code><a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a></code>. For this purpose it has an extended <code><a href="#CL+QT:SETF">setf</a></code> macro that checks if a place is a function in the Q+ package. if so, this place/value pair is instead expanded to a call to the appropriate wrapper function with the function name transformed. However, that's not the only reason to do this. The second is that some setters require multiple arguments to be set at once. Usually, <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/setf">cl:setf</a></code> allows for cases like these by permitting setf expanders to accept multiple values. However, the number of values is fixed, and there's no way to dynamically know how many values where passed. Since Q+ needs to dispatch based on the number of values, this is not a viable approach. Therefore, with <code><a href="#CL+QT:SETF">cl+qt:setf</a></code> a <code>(<a href="#CL+QT:VALUES">values</a> ..)</code> value form is specially treated and its arguments are inlined into the wrapper call. This also means that it isn't possible to use multiple values of a returning function as the values to a setter call, however while that is an inconsistency, I don't think it will be a big issue. If it turns out to be problematic in the later run, this will have to be changed to a dynamic analysis at run-time, which is an overhead I wanted to avoid.</p> <h2>Support</h2> <p>Currently the following implementations are tested and supported by Qtools:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a></li> <li><a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/">CCL</a></li> <li><a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/">ECL</a></li> </ul> <p>You can run it on x86_64 Linux, OS X, and Windows, where SBCL on Linux is the recommended platform.</p> <p>It may or may not work more or less smoothly on other implementations and platforms depending on MOP and CommonQt support and general implementation quirks.</p> </div>  </article> <article id="copyright">  <h2>Copyright</h2> <span>qtools</span> is licensed under the <span><a href="https://tldrlegal.com/search?q=Artistic">Artistic</a></span> license.  © <span>Nicolas Hafner &lt;shinmera@tymoon.eu&gt;</span> .

  An :ITEM form is followed by an identifier, which may

   define on the function.
2. An accessor function QCLASS-basename-FUNCTION that takes a qclass and
   accesses the appropriate method function.
3. A function REMOVE-QCLASS-basename-FUNCTION to remove a method function.

5. A function DISPATCHER that is used as the &quot;generic function&quot;.

Note that multiple-dispatch is not possible with this. Dispatch only ever
happens on the first argument, which must be a qclass instance. There is
also no method combination. Defining a second method on the same qclass will
simply replace the old definition.

However the local CALL-NEXT-METHOD and NEXT-METHOD-P functions are available

(define-user-libs (my-libs #p&quot;~/my-libs/&quot; #p&quot;/some/custom/path&quot;)
  (cffi-lib-name)

This defines two new libraries under the MY-LIBS label. It tells the system
that for both of them it should look in ~/my-libs and /some/custom/path.
The first library is the CFFI library named CFFI-LIB-NAME. The second library
is specified through an explicit pathname.

If the system can find the libraries in the specified locations, it will copy
them to the deployment directory and automatically load them if they were
loaded at the time of dumping (which is usually the case for CFFI).

This is useful if performance really matters and you have to minimise FFI

class-name        --- The Qt class name of the class the method belongs to.

At compile time a matching method number is searched for using
FIND-FASTCALL-METHOD. If no method can be found that matches the class,
name, and argument types, an error is signalled.
The fast call procedure creates a stack for the arguments by WITH-CALL-STACK.
It then uses FAST-DIRECT-CALL on the found method number, class, and
stack to perform the actual call to the method.

Firstly, it calls ENSURE-Q+-METHOD on FUNCTION to
make sure that the function object exists at compile
time. Then it emits a PROGN form that contains two
forms, the first of which is a LOAD-TIME-VALUE form
with a call to ENSURE-Q+-METHOD again. This is required
since the function compiled by ENSURE-Q+-METHOD is not
dumped to file anywhere and thus must be recreated at
load time to be available. The second form in the PROGN
is the actual function call, using the proper symbol

     If true, a message per non-macroexpanded top level form is printed

     processed as top level forms (eg. EVAL-WHEN, MACROLET, PROGN) receive

     a top level SETQ in addition to the message about the IN-PACKAGE form'

  CONTROL-STRING contains a string to be output, possibly with embedded
  directives, which are flagged with the escape character &quot;~&quot;. Directives
  generally expand into additional text to be output, usually consuming one
  or more of the FORMAT-ARGUMENTS in the process. A few useful directives
  are:
        ~A or ~nA   Prints one argument as if by PRINC
        ~S or ~nS   Prints one argument as if by PRIN1
        ~D or ~nD   Prints one argument as a decimal integer
        ~%          Does a TERPRI
        ~&amp;          Does a FRESH-LINE
  where n is the width of the field in which the object is printed.

  DESTINATION controls where the result will go. If DESTINATION is T, then
  the output is sent to the standard output stream. If it is NIL, then the
  output is returned in a string as the value of the call. Otherwise,
  DESTINATION must be a stream to which the output will be sent.

  Example:   (FORMAT NIL &quot;The answer is ~D.&quot; 10) =&gt; &quot;The answer is 10.&quot;

  FORMAT has many additional capabilities not described here. Consult the
  manual for details.</pre></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:FRESH-LINE"> </a> <article> <header class="function"> <span class="type">function</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:FRESH-LINE">FRESH-LINE</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">&amp;OPTIONAL (STREAM *STANDARD-OUTPUT*)</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><i>No docstring provided.</i></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:FROUND"> </a> <article> <header class="function"> <span class="type">function</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:FROUND">FROUND</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">NUMBER &amp;OPTIONAL (DIVISOR 1)</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><pre>Same as ROUND, but returns first value as a float.</pre></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:FTRUNCATE"> </a> <article> <header class="function"> <span class="type">function</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:FTRUNCATE">FTRUNCATE</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">NUMBER &amp;OPTIONAL (DIVISOR 1)</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><pre>Same as TRUNCATE, but returns first value as a float.</pre></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:FUNCALL"> </a> <article> <header class="function"> <span class="type">function</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:FUNCALL">FUNCALL</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">FUNCTION &amp;REST ARGUMENTS</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><pre>Call FUNCTION with the given ARGUMENTS.</pre></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION"> </a> <article> <header class="function"> <span class="type">function</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION">FUNCTION-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">FUN</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><pre>Return (VALUES DEFINING-LAMBDA-EXPRESSION CLOSURE-P NAME), where

This is SLOW as the signal method has to be determined at run-time and it

not actually exist. If you want to explicitly specify the type of the

  :TEST
    Determines how keys are compared. Must a designator for one of the
    standard hash table tests, or a hash table test defined using
    SB-EXT:DEFINE-HASH-TABLE-TEST. Additionally, when an explicit
    HASH-FUNCTION is provided (see below), any two argument equivalence
    predicate can be used as the TEST.

  :SIZE
    A hint as to how many elements will be put in this hash table.

  :REHASH-SIZE
    Indicates how to expand the table when it fills up. If an integer, add
    space for that many elements. If a floating point number (which must be
    greater than 1.0), multiply the size by that amount.

  :REHASH-THRESHOLD
    Indicates how dense the table can become before forcing a rehash. Can be
    any positive number &lt;=1, with density approaching zero as the threshold
    approaches 0. Density 1 means an average of one entry per bucket.

  :HASH-FUNCTION
    If NIL (the default), a hash function based on the TEST argument is used,
    which then must be one of the standardized hash table test functions, or
    one for which a default hash function has been defined using
    SB-EXT:DEFINE-HASH-TABLE-TEST. If HASH-FUNCTION is specified, the TEST
    argument can be any two argument predicate consistent with it. The
    HASH-FUNCTION is expected to return a non-negative fixnum hash code.

  :WEAKNESS
    When :WEAKNESS is not NIL, garbage collection may remove entries from the
    hash table. The value of :WEAKNESS specifies how the presence of a key or
    value in the hash table preserves their entries from garbage collection.

    Valid values are:

      :KEY means that the key of an entry must be live to guarantee that the
        entry is preserved.

      :VALUE means that the value of an entry must be live to guarantee that
        the entry is preserved.

      :KEY-AND-VALUE means that both the key and the value must be live to
        guarantee that the entry is preserved.

      :KEY-OR-VALUE means that either the key or the value must be live to
        guarantee that the entry is preserved.

      NIL (the default) means that entries are always preserved.

  :SYNCHRONIZED
    If NIL (the default), the hash-table may have multiple concurrent readers,
    but results are undefined if a thread writes to the hash-table
    concurrently with another reader or writer. If T, all concurrent accesses
    are safe, but note that CLHS 3.6 (Traversal Rules and Side Effects)
    remains in force. See also: SB-EXT:WITH-LOCKED-HASH-TABLE. This keyword
    argument is experimental, and may change incompatibly or be removed in the
    future.</pre></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:MAKE-LIST"> </a> <article> <header class="function"> <span class="type">function</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:MAKE-LIST">MAKE-LIST</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">SIZE &amp;KEY INITIAL-ELEMENT</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><pre>Constructs a list with size elements each set to value</pre></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS"> </a> <article> <header class="function"> <span class="type">function</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS">MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">OBJECT &amp;KEY (SLOT-NAMES NIL SLOT-NAMES-P) ENVIRONMENT</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><i>No docstring provided.</i></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:MAKE-PACKAGE"> </a> <article> <header class="function"> <span class="type">function</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:MAKE-PACKAGE">MAKE-PACKAGE</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">NAME &amp;KEY (USE 'NIL) NICKNAMES (INTERNAL-SYMBOLS 10) (EXTERNAL-SYMBOLS 10)</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><pre>Make a new package having the specified NAME, NICKNAMES, and USE

individual term will be shown. Matches are case-insensitive and ignore hyphens
as well as underscores and dots.

Example: (q+apropos &quot;qimage format&quot;)

   define on the function.
2. An accessor function QCLASS-basename-FUNCTION that takes a qclass and
   accesses the appropriate method function.
3. A function REMOVE-QCLASS-basename-FUNCTION to remove a method function.

happens on the first argument, which must be a qclass instance. There is
also no method combination. Defining a second method on the same qclass will
simply replace the old definition.

This is useful if performance really matters and you have to minimise FFI
call overhead. In exchange it is required that you specify the exact method
signature you want to call and provide all arguments prepared in their proper
types as no marshalling will be done. FAST-CALL also will not read out the
return value.

METHOD-DESCRIPTOR ::= (name class-name arg-type*)
object            --- The instance of the class to call a method on.
                      Must match the given class-name.
args              --- The arguments to call the method with. Their types
                      must match the ones given in the arg-types and must
                      be prepared. Especially objects must be translated
                      to pointers manually. See QT::QOBJECT-POINTER.
name              --- The Q+ name of the method being called.
class-name        --- The Qt class name of the class the method belongs to.

At compile time a matching method number is searched for using
FIND-FASTCALL-METHOD. If no method can be found that matches the class,
name, and argument types, an error is signalled.
The fast call procedure creates a stack for the arguments by WITH-CALL-STACK.
It then uses FAST-DIRECT-CALL on the found method number, class, and
stack to perform the actual call to the method.

This macro does a bit of a complicated thing:
Firstly, it calls ENSURE-Q+-METHOD on FUNCTION to
make sure that the function object exists at compile
time. Then it emits a PROGN form that contains two
forms, the first of which is a LOAD-TIME-VALUE form
with a call to ENSURE-Q+-METHOD again. This is required
since the function compiled by ENSURE-Q+-METHOD is not
dumped to file anywhere and thus must be recreated at
load time to be available. The second form in the PROGN

TRACE is a debugging tool that provides information when specified
functions are called. In its simplest form:

       (TRACE NAME-1 NAME-2 ...)

The NAMEs are not evaluated. Each may be a symbol, denoting an
individual function, or a string, denoting all functions fbound to
symbols whose home package is the package with the given name.

Options allow modification of the default behavior. Each option is a
pair of an option keyword and a value form. Global options are
specified before the first name, and affect all functions traced by a
given use of TRACE. Options may also be interspersed with function
names, in which case they act as local options, only affecting tracing
of the immediately preceding function name. Local options override
global options.

By default, TRACE causes a printout on *TRACE-OUTPUT* each time that
one of the named functions is entered or returns. (This is the basic,
ANSI Common Lisp behavior of TRACE.) As an SBCL extension, the
:REPORT SB-EXT:PROFILE option can be used to instead cause information
to be silently recorded to be inspected later using the SB-EXT:PROFILE
function.

The following options are defined:

   :REPORT Report-Type
       If Report-Type is TRACE (the default) then information is reported
       by printing immediately. If Report-Type is SB-EXT:PROFILE, information
       is recorded for later summary by calls to SB-EXT:PROFILE. If
       Report-Type is NIL, then the only effect of the trace is to execute
       other options (e.g. PRINT or BREAK).

   :CONDITION Form
   :CONDITION-AFTER Form
   :CONDITION-ALL Form
       If :CONDITION is specified, then TRACE does nothing unless Form
       evaluates to true at the time of the call. :CONDITION-AFTER is
       similar, but suppresses the initial printout, and is tested when the
       function returns. :CONDITION-ALL tries both before and after.
       This option is not supported with :REPORT PROFILE.

   :BREAK Form
   :BREAK-AFTER Form
   :BREAK-ALL Form
       If specified, and Form evaluates to true, then the debugger is invoked
       at the start of the function, at the end of the function, or both,
       according to the respective option.

   :PRINT Form
   :PRINT-AFTER Form
   :PRINT-ALL Form
       In addition to the usual printout, the result of evaluating Form is
       printed at the start of the function, at the end of the function, or
       both, according to the respective option. Multiple print options cause
       multiple values to be printed.

   :WHEREIN Names
       If specified, Names is a function name or list of names. TRACE does
       nothing unless a call to one of those functions encloses the call to
       this function (i.e. it would appear in a backtrace.)  Anonymous
       functions have string names like &quot;DEFUN FOO&quot;. This option is not
       supported with :REPORT PROFILE.

   :ENCAPSULATE {:DEFAULT | T | NIL}
       If T, the tracing is done via encapsulation (redefining the function
       name) rather than by modifying the function. :DEFAULT is the default,
       and means to use encapsulation for interpreted functions and funcallable
       instances, breakpoints otherwise. When encapsulation is used, forms are
       *not* evaluated in the function's lexical environment, but SB-DEBUG:ARG
       can still be used.

   :METHODS {T | NIL}
       If T, any function argument naming a generic function will have its
       methods traced in addition to the generic function itself.

   :FUNCTION Function-Form
       This is a not really an option, but rather another way of specifying
       what function to trace. The Function-Form is evaluated immediately,
       and the resulting function is instrumented, i.e. traced or profiled
       as specified in REPORT.

:CONDITION, :BREAK and :PRINT forms are evaluated in a context which
mocks up the lexical environment of the called function, so that
SB-DEBUG:VAR and SB-DEBUG:ARG can be used.
The -AFTER and -ALL forms can use SB-DEBUG:ARG.</pre></div> </article> </li><li> <a name="CL+QT:TYPECASE"> </a> <article> <header class="macro"> <span class="type">macro</span>  <code>(</code><h4 class="name"><code><a href="#CL+QT:TYPECASE">TYPECASE</a></code></h4> <code class="qualifiers"></code> <code class="arguments">KEYFORM &amp;BODY CASES</code><code>)</code>  </header> <div class="docstring"><pre>TYPECASE Keyform {(Type Form*)}*

It is
intended to be eg. wrapped around the compilation of all files in the same system.

Following options are defined:

  :OVERRIDE Boolean-Form
      One of the effects of this form is to delay undefined warnings until the
      end of the form, instead of giving them at the end of each compilation.
      If OVERRIDE is NIL (the default), then the outermost
      WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT form grabs the undefined warnings. Specifying
      OVERRIDE true causes that form to grab any enclosed warnings, even if it
      is enclosed by another WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.

  :POLICY Optimize-Declaration-Form
      Provides dynamic scoping for global compiler optimization qualities and
      restrictions, limiting effects of subsequent OPTIMIZE proclamations and
      calls to SB-EXT:RESTRICT-COMPILER-POLICY to the dynamic scope of BODY.

      If OVERRIDE is false, specified POLICY is merged with current global
      policy. If OVERRIDE is true, current global policy, including any
      restrictions, is discarded in favor of the specified POLICY.

      Supplying POLICY NIL is equivalent to the option not being supplied at
      all, ie. dynamic scoping of policy does not take place.

      This option is an SBCL-specific experimental extension: Interface
      subject to change.

  :SOURCE-NAMESTRING Namestring-Form
      Attaches the value returned by the Namestring-Form to the internal
      debug-source information as the namestring of the source file. Normally
      the namestring of the input-file for COMPILE-FILE is used: this option
      can be used to provide source-file information for functions compiled
      using COMPILE, or to override the input-file of COMPILE-FILE.

      If both an outer and an inner WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT provide a
      SOURCE-NAMESTRING, the inner one takes precedence. Unaffected
      by :OVERRIDE.

      This is an SBCL-specific extension.

  :SOURCE-PLIST Plist-Form
      Attaches the value returned by the Plist-Form to internal debug-source
      information of functions compiled in within the dynamic extent of BODY.

      Primarily for use by development environments, in order to eg. associate
      function definitions with editor-buffers. Can be accessed using
      SB-INTROSPECT:DEFINITION-SOURCE-PLIST.

      If an outer WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT form also provide a SOURCE-PLIST, it
      is appended to the end of the provided SOURCE-PLIST. Unaffected
      by :OVERRIDE.

      This is an SBCL-specific extension.

Examples:

  ;; Prevent proclamations from the file leaking, and restrict
  ;; SAFETY to 3 -- otherwise uses the current global policy.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy '(optimize))
    (restrict-compiler-policy 'safety 3)
    (load &quot;foo.lisp&quot;))

  ;; Using default policy instead of the current global one,
  ;; except for DEBUG 3.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy '(optimize debug)
                          :override t)
    (load &quot;foo.lisp&quot;))

  ;; Same as if :POLICY had not been specified at all: SAFETY 3
  ;; proclamation leaks out from WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT.
  (with-compilation-unit (:policy nil)
